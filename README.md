# Project: I Am Learning Python

### Turtle Race

- This project is a simple Turtle Racing Game built with Python's turtle module. The game allows users to place a bet on the color of a turtle, and watch as six turtles race across the screen. The user inputs their bet on which turtle will win, and the game tells them if they won or lost after the race.

---
### Features:

- User Interaction: The player can place a bet on which turtle (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple) will win the race.
- Random Race Mechanics: Each turtle moves a random distance on each iteration, making the race unpredictable.
- Colorful Turtles: The game features six turtles of different colors, each starting at different vertical positions.
- Race Outcome: Once a turtle reaches the finish line, the game announces the winner and whether the player won their bet.
